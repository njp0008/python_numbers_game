# python_numbers_game
I'm currently learning Python in order to eventually learn Pandas/NumPy for data analysis. I wanted to make a github to not only show off what I've learned, but to also help cement my understanding of each topic.
A fun guessing game! You have to pick a number between 0 and 400. There are only 3 chances to guess right!
